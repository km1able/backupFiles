--> event queues / messaging broadcasat
(from gameprogrammingpatterns.com)
Register events/ messages for in game events ( i.e. monster dies) 
--> use arrays with 'ring buffers' (head/tails, process through arrays) 
-queues: 
    -single cast
        -all sender knows is it sent messages
        -queues are more encapsulated
        -decided whether registered listeners or only one get message
    -broadcast 
        - if ten event listeners are registered to the event, 
            then all ten see the event
    -work 
        -multiple listeners 
        -each item in queues only goes to one 
            -common for parcelling jobs to pool of concurrent threads
        -HAVE to schedule. 
            -determine best choice for message recipient
