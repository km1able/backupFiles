Who knew 
Where the Shit went in Labryinthe
I think that's where he's lived
For some time
Managed to walk in one day 
Hasn't really left since
Considering the vexing nature of it
One end is another beginning 
That takes one back to yesterday 
Or a year before 
And journeying on only takes time 
That there's either 
Too much of 
or too little

The malaise that led to some kind of excitement
And then the city unravelled itself
Rebuilding itself the next day 
Packed still neatly 
At least in the understructure
Until you followed it to where it went 

"Follow the Shit, Math" 
"Go a half past Hourglass (a township or a 
Magical Place)" 
"Don't forget to look back" 
"Or else you'll miss it" 

And more riddles
And maps 
Of a maze that constantly changed
But remained the same 
In an analagous way 

And regardless
The plumbing was always Neat
for some Reason 

Despite the changing climate 
Above 
If one dug deep in the mud
You'd find a mystery 
I don't like to tell 
Or consider 
To say there was an end to it 

And Eternal Life

Considering one could dig day and night
and never find Christ
considering what words from me

It hurts
The struggle inside
of this Mortal Life
and Immortality 

And the considerations 
And the words 

So I continue. 

"Manage one's time" 
"And don't forget to climb" 
"Just don't go too high" 
One might not be prepared for the Journey. 

I suppose there was always a journey in Labryinthe. 
A ticket sale 
To this year's Summer Gala 
Like last year's and the year's before 
But this time might be different - 
At least so it'd seem 

And end up the same way. 

But either way, 
the Shit would still flow downstream 
Even if the occupants managed to create 
An Entropic Catastrophe of Disaster
(It would have been a better promise) 
Or more truthful. 

Instead of "Songbirds and Parades" 
As advertised 
It'd read 
"A Play of Death and Grievance, 
Written in Reality" 
But he never could manage to say the Truth 
to whoever was advertising 

That he'd been there before 
And for some reason 
He was one of the few who could remember

I suppose it was just the Agony of his Adventure

So let's just say 
It began everyday 
In exactly the same way 

0530 - Arise
and fight the urge of whatever was there that day 
Exciting to be sure!
Perhaps that was just his difficulty 
Was found in Bounding Up! 
With such Skill and Great Luck!
To still be there. 
And out the door at six. 

To begin the climb. 

Everyday - 
Up the Mountain to the City Center? 
Or a different direction today. 

And I suppose one decides then 
In this game that I play
...which at least it's already begun 
The tale not even spun 
If only to continue and go 
This way or that 

And maybe that's the whole point 
is to find Eternal Life. 

I suppose that means one wins then. 

And a momment to excuse myself. 

And then continue. 

"It's just a game, this place" 
I suppose that's Sarah, three years into the race
"It just starts over again each day, 
and nothing changes" 

Though I'm not convinced about her character
She wasn't there when I was going through it

What I went through with Math. 
THat I could close my eyes 
And fight through the sickness of my mind 
And take myself to some kind of fantasy 
And be there for a while 
Where everything made more sense then 

Though it might be: 
Artificial 
or otherwise 
...Devicive? 
(Contrived - that was the word I meant
and recognized later)
I can't find the words sometimes.  
Suppose I will make another folder 
"Geographies of Labyrinthe's Suburbs" 
or Wheels 
or Disks 
Nodes might be right 
considering they might ultimately be connected by a graph 
That might not make much sense. 
It winds back on itself 
and then around again 
And one node connects to the other
And there's no sense to it. 
As if it were all inside a Painting
With Individual Scenes 
And one Reality Connected to another 
Or simply Sparsely Interfaced 

It's just randomly generated 
Maybe with some kind of Reason or Rules
As neccessarily generic as 
Plumbing Shit
Which seems to have taken a whole other meaning 

Infrastructure! 
City Planning!

Imagineably they're useful things 

I heard a story once 
of a boy 
Who was excited - as joyful as could be
To be - hired or find an internist job 
Working at what I think was a waste disposal facility 

...Maybe that'd be me one day 
"So this is where all the shit goes..." 
-How fascinating. 
And Dimunition. 

That maybe somehow that's My struggle
Like the serial killers in my dreams at night 
and the one who told me 
What I'd said wasn't the deepest metaphor he'd ever heard. 

...
And Black. 

Not that I remember that. 

Except every day. 
...But enough about that. 

I can't remember its Utility.  
Or if there were Truth to it. 
All I know is the Nervousness of it 
The constant struggle and the fight 
Day and Night 
Every single moment I'm alive
Awake or asleep 
That it's all embedded, ingrained within me 

That one time I had not remembered what Life is 
And if this is what it is
Then at least there's these words

Or those words

But at least these words are mine. 
Though I wish they were more...
Better. 
More meaningful. 
More inspired. 

I try to forget the lyricality of them. 
Though I'm want to just start chanting 
"It seems as though the right path to take -" 
Perhaps I've simply never known better. 
Of a verse 
That might seem Clever
Or Well-Thought Out 

But if there be Beauty - 
Then may it be here? 
If only for me but for a little while
So I might find peace. 

And it's what I Have - This
Maybe it's the Rape that made him. 
It's what defined his Character - it was the Rape 
He committed. 

Time and again. 
Maybe from his lack of diligence. 
It was 
Comical 
In Jest
There Upon Request

And I'd rather it be from the Blight 
That he'd found Underground 
The ones that Didn't Make Any Sound
But were Always Quite Loud 
When they murdered him. 
Like the Undead. 

And it grew in his mind 
Like Poetry inside 
Until it grew like a vine 
And strangled him. 

Time and again. 
But he had his Pistol. 
He had a rifle, too.
Which he seldom would use. 
It was just too long for the Narrows. 
Which must make him one of the Sparrows. 
If they had names or needed them for a group 
Or a flock 
Or a swarm 
Or Soldiers Radically Transformed
From the Cauldron. 

Mine was different. 
If I had my own. 

Suffice it to say they had Patterns. 
The Blight. 
They didn't move in the light. 
They only came out at night. 
And only enough to feed and then disperse again beneath. 

I just can't remember what types
They were in the Deep. 
Zombie-esque masses
Deformed walking caskets
Without bodies 
Only Remnant Souls Burning Alive 
Without Words only Voices  

Like Terror 
Causing Arythmias
And Disparagement. 

And I love him 
Because that's what he fought. 
My guy. 
The one I made up. 
That gets me through it at night. 
I just want to bring him to Life
So we could find Wellness together. 

...I know how to. 
But it's a Climb. 
Through a long and difficult maze everyday. 
And it's Tiring and Toilsome and Hopeless sometimes. 

It's all in my dreams 
Not that it's not Out There Someplace
That it is Horror - at least it's Horrific
I don't know if it's - 
Abandonment itself. 

I tell myself there's little else more terrifying 
...

So thanks guy. 
Maybe we'll find a way through it together. 

So that's where you sleep 
is Beneath The Waking World 
-There's not much purchase for you there. 
It's too noisy. 
And the minute screeching isn't too terrible sometimes. 
Some of the Creatures are cute in a way. 
Like Deformed Aliens from Outerspace that don't go out of there way 
Though some are from another dimension of Fright 
That don't even exist, 
Yet they manage to Destroy shit. 
...I don't know how to program that. 
Maybe just a Pertub'ed wave - 
A good chance to learn about Modelling. 
Chaotic Vibrations and Dynamical Systems...

A bit along the way. 
Not many pebbles and stones there. 
Just broken Glass 
From the Nethervoid. 

And some kind of Gate that Ben and Sarah came from. 
Just happened along one day. 
Earthplace takes too long sometimes. 
And Ben needed an Uzi. 
It's just nice to a nine year old boy with a submachine gun 
Killing something from the Dark Dimension 
...
Only it's already Dead, Ben. 
You can't sever its head. 
It'll just grow another one. 

Normally it's just shit. 
But it grows heads from there, too. 
If you kill it enough. 

Maybe I'm off track. 

*I lost my way again. 
The course it winds
Back and forth 
And wherein an Epiphany from me? 
No words 
For this Pestilence of mine. 

I forgot this morning
The words I wrote
In my mind. 
There was a title - 
About one thing or the other. 
And these Motivations of mine

The words - they must Be Capitalized Sometimes. 
I don't Always Know why. 
There is Surely A Reason. 

There's a reason for things - 
For the way the river bends 
The way that it - 
Let's just Pause there for a moment
Let's just go nice and easy down the little creek 
and enjoy the Rowboating and the Sailing. 
Surely one remembers. 
A quiet afternoon in a forest in Texas. 
And a Red Canoe 
with Guy on the Planet Earth At the Time. 
Perhaps he had a Soul
I would believe it to Be a Truthful Thing 

Let his Soul not be Discouraged. 
And I am not some Soul-Whispering Jew 
To go and Give Water to a Cup 
Or say that I will Mend You if you are broken
I have only my own fissures to attend to - 
That is all. 

Of These Fissures: 
I might as well be a Jew. 
I ache, Lord. 
I'm pretty sure that means I might be Jewish. 
I hurt - 
Therefore, I must be a Jew. 

O, you Suffer, Child!
...
Who are you, a Jew? 

Ha. 
I'm a funny guy that way. 
But that might involve me being required to be with Other Jews 
And they might take offense if I went on about Christ Jesus 

I tell myself it'd be nice if it were at least The Truth. 

And so forth. 
It's mostly a Smirking Comedy to me. 
Maybe I have moments of Stalwart Impregnable Character. 
I am not a Rock, Lord. 

A Sponge. 
Just sucking along the bottom of an Ocean someplace. 
What with all of my Comedies. 

The suffering of Jews, Lord! 
Very comical.

I've told myself I should quite pretending 
Rational Thought is something I have any interest in. 
A bit above my reach 
For whatever it is I am. 
In the way that I exist. 

Perhaps I will get bored and write 
Salvation. 

Wouldn't that be nice. 
Just O, 
And then a word
And then Salvation. 

And here I am - 
Out of my bed 
And wrestling over 
Such a Concept. 

I should have stuck with Rice. 
Nevermind. 
"I should have stuck with Rice.
This Barley is not right." 

Look, Lord, it's like something someone said one time. 

I must stop. 

I return to my Character. 
And his Fairy Tale world. 
Of struggling with Demon Plagues from the Void 
(By that, I mean, they might as well be Jews, Lord)

Ha. 

Such a Comedy. 

I don't know if you have ever Wrestled a Jew before. 
Perhaps one day, child. 
You will go
with your Might 
and be like Christ Jesus
and Wrestle with a Jew. 

Ha. 
That would be a comedy. 
If Jesus were to wrestle 

I would say it was with Resurrection, Lord!
Perhaps then - some difficulty. 
Do not let it be Easy, Lord. 
It is not good for the Child. 
It lives inside of your Universe, 
Such as everything with all your Authority
That I struggle with. 
In the way that one goes on about a god 
And its possessions. 

Surely I don't remember what it was that you had kept 
And considering your belonging. 
Or if it had been Precious. 
Etc. 

And there is no Food for me to chew on 
Except this Fat you have given me - 
It would have been better if I simply had 
Watched The Partridge Family 
and said - 
That is Enough. 
Look at Mrs. Partridge,
There - 
Now that is Character!
And Mr. Partridge - 
My goodness. 
Always working. 
But always time for -
Some kind of Laugh 
And what have you. 

And John Thorne and the Burning Spark

I wished I'd have written that down. 
I can't remember what Journey he had been on. 
One that ended in His Own Death 
And a period of questioning where he examined his life thereafter 
And Wondered about things. 

And My Soldiers Immortal
And Ra-Ra
And Play 

One time 
My mind exploded
While on MDMA 
And I 
Got stuck inside
Myself. 
Or Was it someone else then? 
...We're different, me and him 
He might not have ever written this 
With a Pen! 
(Or typed)
A pen might be Expressive
The Jabbering Scrawl 
...
The Gibberish Bit 
Put It All In The Story 
Say It Was Some Dramatic Shit
I did one time. 
Once upon...
Once upon a day. 
When my life changed. 
From MDMA. 

A - 
Where to begin 
B. 
A->B
Then C. 
Then A. 
Then B. 
Then The Alphabet 
Phonetically 
And then Repeat
But this time Rhyme 
In a sublime rythym 
if the scheme involed a Neverending 
Feedback Reel 
of screaming. 

Terrible pain. 
But the rain came one day. 
Washing it all away 
For a moment. 
I should write it. 
For myself. 

All of it! 
Or what's left of it. 
The Schizophrenic Mental Twist 
of a Deranged 
Felon 

And back in again 
It'd be nice to see 
my Character Dive 
Like I see inside a dream 
The simple thought 
That I never Would

But I think I did one time. 
Into the Beyond. 
Into a Terrible Thing 
Not knowing 
Where it would lead...

I suppose here. 
And here 
And here. 
For the moment. 
And a chance to learn 
Math. 
Because why not. 
It's expressive in a way 
It might be hard to find Truth therein 
Beauty, like some people say 
Usually I go with Why 
How does this Apply 

I suppose to fight Cybernetic Aliens with Capable 
Feelings from a Nethervoid Crystal 
Representing or Symbolizing Something 
In something of a Pilgrimage 
of Merit. 
And the memories along the way. 
I've changed. 
I'm Strange. 
And the Strangling. 
The Dangling 'Glerk' - 
if that's the sound 
when a Neck Drops from a Noose
Obtuse
Oblong 
It never really connects quite right 
The Reason has dissipated - 
Entropic
Rarely Symantically or Synaptically Connected
Just loosely affiliated 

But that's where all this is from. 
I'm dumber than shit 
Often enough 
But sometimes 
I can see through the Fright 
Like the water draining down last night 
And Whatever This One Was About 
Has finished. 

Last night it was a Shark, a Hammerhead
That bit on the line, 
With me and another holding on. 
Afraid 
Of the gripping, ripping jaws

But it passed
(It's better than when it doesn't, that much I'll say) 
Which happens sometimes. 
Sometimes, I fail to find 
The Appropriate Conclusion 

Maybe it's just Permanent Mental Disease
Like the way I feel most of the time 
Disconnected
Vacant
Out of Control. 
Like the Chemistry isn't quite right. 
Hoping it will get better
But mostly knowing it won't. 

So we're along for the ride now. 
And the other day - 
And the other day - 
And the last time - 
And all of it.
