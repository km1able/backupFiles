- A Wizard Arcanium for the Mentally Ill 

Simultaneous Wizards who are also Unfit for Proper Society 
And full of Spelling  
And Grammar
And Tedium 
And Words 
Just Words Words Words
and no truth. 

Cells - not rooms. 
Even among groups
No groups, 
just cells  
No life
Just cells. 

Why not. 
Considering what I understand about Biological Life. 
It gets distorted by Disparagement and Discouragement? 
Because no one was in the Bleeding Army of What all.  
That's where Life is in Labryinthe 
In the Bleeding Army of What-All 
And no one has any idea where it is. 
But it's around someplace. 

You just have to find it. 
Or it finds you. 
Or is another Fiction I've contrived (that's the word I was searching for) 
Contrivance. 

98 percent of all of this is a 
Contrivance 
- Some shit I made up in my brain 
And consider 'worth doing' somehow. 

Contrived Knowledge. 
Contrived Learning. 
Contrived Reasons. 
And usually unfounded or at least not 
Appropriately Formed 
(certainly for any kind of Respectable Academia) 

And thus it was in Hourglass
Where all the Wizards ended up 
Wracked in Bleeding Agony 

For their words. 
Hubris was written therein. 
Futility presented itself daily
As a prerequisite task.  
And Accomplishment was Fairly Rare. 
Pride gave way to Vanity
And all kinds of Bullshit 

That was never as practical 
as Plumbing Shit. 

It might be - 
the disease in me 
(at least one of them) 
Is that everything I do is primarily 
based in Delinquency and Failure
And Rejection 

And every story I write is principally: 
"The character must go through Abandondment to find -" 
Worth or Truth or What have you.
