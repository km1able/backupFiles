What am I say to to myself 
Through the years
And the pain - the confusion every day 
THe jogged memories and the pressure in my head

That maybe I am sick 
And need help 

Who do I have but myself 
What would the others know
or need to 

That I couldn't say 
Where the hatred came from 
or when it first appeared in memories
Or how long it had been brewing
before it blew over the wall 
And surged 
Flooded my soul and my mind 
Until there was nothing else 
Except to hope it would one day vanish 
or be vanquished 

But at least the narrative has transformed into 
A poem 
Such as it is
With line breaks and semicolons 
Instead of paragraphs 

It must be the passing of time 
And all the Beauty
