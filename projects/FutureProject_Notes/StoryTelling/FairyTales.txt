Fairy tales 
And happy conclusions
Were reached in the twilight 
And a dark night 
Closed 
Into the breach 
and Wielded 
A Fierce Brightness
That sank beneath 
The sea 
Churning and boiling 
With fright 

A song played 
Upon a stage 
Singularly heard 
Amidst the revelling yells 
And screeches 
of chairs when they played 
Giving way to the darkness
