Vulkan: 
-Descriptor Sets, Descriptor Pools
Push Constants, (max 124 bytes of data) 
Also Push Descriptors (Vulkan Tutorial): (don't neccessarily need descriptor pool or set) 
    --> push up the same data packed into a VkWriteDescriptorSet vector you would have otherwise used to 
        create the descriptor set via vkAllocateDescriptorSets and vkUpdateDescriptorSets
    --> Also consider Per Object basis for Shaders/Sets
